## What GitMood Analyzes

For each commit, GitMood determines:

- **Sentiment** - Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- **Change Type** - Feature, Bug Fix, Refactoring, Documentation, Test, etc.
- **Code Quality** - Well-structured, rushed, complex, clean refactoring, etc.
- **Reasoning** - Why the sentiment was assigned

### Sentiment Indicators

- ‚úÖ **POSITIVE**
  - Well-documented changes
  - Tests included
  - Code simplification/refactoring
  - Clear commit messages

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEUTRAL**
  - Standard bug fixes
  - Routine updates
  - Documentation changes

- ‚ùå **NEGATIVE**
  - Large diffs with minimal explanation
  - TODOs or console.logs in code
  - Incomplete changes
  - Rushed commits

## Configuration

### Required Settings

- **API Key**
  - Enter in the sidebar OR
  - Set in VS Code Settings: `gitmood.geminiApiKey`

### Optional Settings

Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`) and search for "GitMood":

- **`gitmood.commitLimit`** (Default: 20)
  - Maximum number of commits to analyze
  - Recommended: 10-30 for best results

- **`gitmood.analyzeType`** (Default: "full-diff")
  - `full-diff`: Analyze with complete code diffs (detailed but slower)
  - `stats-only`: Analyze with file statistics only (faster)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Full Diffs** - Set `analyzeType` to "full-diff" for more detailed analysis
2. **Good Commit Messages** - Clear, descriptive messages help AI understand intent
3. **Reasonable Limit** - 15-30 commits usually provides good insights without too much data
4. **Include Code Context** - Diffs with code changes provide richer analysis than messages alone

## Troubleshooting

### "Please enter your Gemini API key" Error

Make sure you've entered your API key in the sidebar input field.

### "No workspace folder is open" Error

- Open a folder/workspace in VS Code (File ‚Üí Open Folder)
- Make sure it's a Git repository

### "No commits found" Error

- Ensure you're in a Git repository
- Verify Git is installed: `git --version`
- Check repository has commits: `git log`

### Sidebar Not Showing

- Look for the pulse icon in the Activity Bar (left side)
- If hidden, right-click Activity Bar and enable GitMood
- Reload VS Code if needed

### Slow Analysis

- Reduce `commitLimit` setting to analyze fewer commits
- Use `analyzeType: "stats-only"` for faster analysis
- Check your internet connection
